# RedDwarf-JS

RedDwarf-JS is a Javascript client library for [RedDwarf](http://reddwarf.sourceforge.net/) (formerly [Project Darkstar](http://projectdarkstar.com/)).


## Installation

1. Install [Twisted](http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/Downloads). (Requires [Python](http://python.org/).)
2. Install [Orbited](http://orbited.org/wiki/Installation). (On my Macbook, all I had to do was use Python's easy_install facility: `easy_install orbited` and `easy_install simplejson`.)
3. Download [RedDwarf Server](http://reddwarf.sourceforge.net/). (To run it, you'll need Java 6. On a 64-bit Mac you can get it via Software Update.)


## Running the example client

1. Get a command prompt in the RedDwarf-JS directory and then run `orbited`
2. Get a command prompt in the directory where you downloaded RedDwarf Server and start the SwordWorld (or HelloChannels or whatever) server by running `java -jar bin/sgs-boot.jar tutorial/conf/SwordWorld.boot`
3. Point your web browser at [http://localhost:9000/example/example.html](http://localhost:9000/example/example.html)


## Credits

This is just a port of the [Darkstar-as3](http://code.google.com/p/darkstar-as3/) code over to Javascript. Thanks go to the people who wrote that, and the whole Project Darkstar/RedDwarf team. (Though if it doesn't work, it's probably my fault - it's very possible that I didn't port the code quite right.)


## Disclaimer

I can't promise that this code will work for you. I've tried it out with HelloChannels and SwordWorld, on a few different browsers (Safari and Firefox and Chrome on my Macbook, and IE8 and Chrome on Windows XP). Please [let me know](mailto:adam.spitz@gmail.com) if you find bugs or have questions or comments.
